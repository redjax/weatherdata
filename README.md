# WeatherData Monorepo <!-- omit in toc -->

I use weather APIs frequently to help me learn programming things. I'm continuing that trend by learning to build a monorepo with Python and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

## Requirements

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv): The packages (and the repository itself) are managed with `uv`.
  - If you haven't already tried it, you should!
  - `uv` can [even install Python for you](), meaning `uv` is the only dependency you need to install for this monorepo.
- (Optional) Python: If you want to install Python (or already have it installed), `uv` will use the system version of your Python.

## Setup

- Clone this repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/redjax/weatherdata`
- Create your configuration files
  - Copy the following files in [`config/`](./config):
    - General configurations:
      - `settings.toml` -> `settings.local.toml`
      - `.secrets.toml` -> `.secrets.local.toml`
    - Database configuration:
      - `database/settings.toml` -> `database/settings.local.toml`
      - `database/.secrets.toml` -> `database/.secrets.local.toml`
    - [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) configuration:
      - **NOTE**: You need to sign up for a [free API key on WeatherAPI's site](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx).
      - `weatherapi/settings.toml` -> `weatherapi/settings.local.toml`
      - `weatherapi/.secrets.toml` -> `weatherapi/.secrets.local.toml`
- Run `uv sync` to install required packages
  - This repository uses [`uv` workspaces](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) to build modules in [`applications/`](./applications) and [`packages`](./packages).
  - Each of the projects in these directories is a Python package with a `pyproject.toml` file, intialized with `uv init --package`.
  - When `uv` runs any part of this repository, it will build everything and then execute the command you ran.
  - If you want to manually build the project, you can run `uv build`

## Usage

Once you have installed the project (read the [setup instructions](#setup)), you can run different entrypoints with `uv run`. For example, to launch the [`weather_cli` app](./applications/cli/), you can run:

```shell
uv run python -m weather_cli
```

Or to see the [sandbox demo](./sandbox/demo/demo.py), you can just run:

```shell
uv run sandbox/demo/demo.py
```

You can omit `python` in your `uv run` commands; `uv` knows what you're trying to do when you run a `.py` file ðŸ˜‰ The exception to this rule is when running packages as a module, as you would with `python -m`. You still need to add that to your `uv` command.

### Using the monorepo

Developing in a monorepo is different from developing in other "flatter" repositories. In a regular repository, you might only have 1 service or application defined in your code. In a monorepo, you can define many services/applications and shared dependencies. You can bring various parts of the application together by installing modules in other modules (like the [`depends` package](./packages/depends/pyproject.toml), which import its settings in the `[tool.uv.sources]` section from the `settings` module: settings = { workspace = true }), import from other areas of the monorepo, and share code more easily between different applications and services.

Each type of repository has its purpose and place; I am choosing to structure this project as a monorepo so I can learn how to manage and work with them. Neither is better than the other, a good developer will choose when a monorepository format is right for their project.

### Adding packages

To add new packages to the app, create a path in [`packages/`](./packages) and initialize it with `uv init --package`. For example, to add a package named `nb_functions`, you might run the following commands:

```shell
## Create the directory where the package will live
mkdir -pv ./packages/notebook-functions
cd ./packages/notebook-functions

## Create the src directory & __init__.py/main.py files
mkdir -pv ./src/nb_functions
touch ./src/nb_functions/{__init__,main}.py

## Initialize the uv package
uv init --package

## Add code from another module in this repository, i.e. http-lib
uv add http-lib
```

Note that the source code name (`nb_functions`) differs from the parent path name (`notebook-functions`). You need to modify the new `pyproject.toml` file that was created when you ran `uv init --package`.

When a package's name differs from the parent directory like this, you will see an error like this when you try to add packages, build, or run anything with `uv`:

```
ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel using the following heuristics: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection

The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (notebook-functions).

At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/

As an example, if you intend to ship a directory named `foo` that resides within a `src` directory located at the root of your project, you can define the following:

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/foo"]
```

The fix for this is details in that last part of the error message. We need to add a section like the following to tell `uv` where the code it needs to build for this package lives:

```toml
## packages/notebook-functions/src/nb_functions/pyproject.toml

...


```
