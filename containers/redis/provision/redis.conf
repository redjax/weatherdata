## Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
#  it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
#  1k => 1000 bytes
#  1kb => 1024 bytes
#  1m => 1000000 bytes
#  1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
#  1g => 1000000000 bytes
#  1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
#  units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

## The first 'bind' is redis' default, and only allows connections from localhost (within the container).
#  To allow outside connections, comment the first 'bind' and uncomment the second.
# bind 127.0.0.1 -::1
bind 0.0.0.0

## When protected mode is on and the default user has no password, the server
# only accepts local connections from the IPv4 address (127.0.0.1), IPv6 address
# (::1) or Unix domain sockets.
protected-mode yes

## Port redis server runs on in the container.
#  If you change this, you need to update the 'ports' section for the redis container.
#  If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379

## Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

## Specify the server verbosity level.
#  This can be one of:
#    debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
#    verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
#    notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
#    warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
#    nothing (nothing is logged)
loglevel verbose

## Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
#  Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
#  output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile ""
